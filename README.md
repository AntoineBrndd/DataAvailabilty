# Folder DarkField film quality
Is the two image to determine film quality. The pixel/um ratio is 11

# Folder LossIR
Al2O3ellipso.xlsx is the ellipsometry measurement data

Al2O3waveguideFinal.xlsx is the result of simulation with effective refactive index and losses given as function of the wavelength

	Folder CSVAndExcel
	CutBackIRSo40.xlsx give three tabler: width is the different width of each waveguide; BroadCutBack1200nm1700nm list every corresponding specta measured and link to the specifier waveguide and length; Length refers to the length of each waveguide measured
	WaveDataXXXXX are CSV with the first colonm being the wavelength(nm) and the second the intensity measured. Some data present are not used in the publication, only the one who gave coherent result (loss <0 and high SNR)

# FolderVis
Give the images used to determine the losses in visible and for the two different sample (So40 and So41)
The resolution is 0.575Âµm/px
